        <title>Student loans &amp; the US government&#39;s looming subprime crisis</title>

&lt;p&gt;in 2015, student loans accounted for 26% of the US federal government’s total assets as reported. ($845.1 billion of the $3,229.8 billion). This is a 3.5% increase since 2014 ($731.2B of $3,065.3B). This pails in comparision to to the $21,451.7 in liabilities owed by the governement.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Direct loans and loan guarantee programs are used to promote the Nation’s welfare by making financing available to
segments of the population not served adequately by non-federal institutions, or otherwise providing for certain activities or
investments. For those unable to afford credit at the market rate, federal credit programs provide subsidies in the form of
direct loans offered at an interest rate lower than the market rate. For those to whom non-federal financial institutions are
reluctant to grant credit because of the high risk involved, federal credit programs guarantee the payment of these non-federal
loans and absorb the cost of defaults.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;var x = function {  }&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This project is amazing and hot reloading&lt;/p&gt;
